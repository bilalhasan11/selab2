Library Management System.
Intro:
We have to create a simple library system through collaborative development with a partner using GitHub. Our task was to set up a repository on GitHub, create and manage project files, commit and push changes, collaborate with a friend, create branches, and finally merge our work. This collaborative effort allowed us to develop a basic library system and also  to achieve  experience GitHub plateform.
Steps:

*2.1. Repository Creation*

The first step was to create a new repository on GitHub. We named the repository 'lab3' and set it to be public. This repository served as the central location for our project, allowing us to collaborate,

*2.2. Collaborator Invitation*
One of us initiated the repository and sent an invitation to the other as a collaborator. This ensured both of us had access to the repository and could work on the project together.

*3.1. File Creation*
We started by creating essential project files such as 'library.py' for the core functionality, 'README.md' for documentation, and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies. These files were added to the repository.
*3.2. Commit and Push*
We then made our initial commits, which involved adding the created files to the repository. Each commit had a message outlining the changes made. After committing, we pushed our changes to the remote repository, making them available for on GitHub website

**4. Collaboration and Branching**

*4.1. Collaboration Workflow*

To work on the project simultaneously, we communicated through GitHub and agreed on a workflow. We decided to focus on different parts of the library system to avoid conflicts. 
One of us worked on functionalities like signup, book issuance and availability functionality while other one did other necessary functionalities.

*4.2. Creating Branches*

To work on specific features or tasks independently, we created branches. One of us created a branch for his requirement and assigned functionalities  while the other created a branch according to is requirement and assigned functionalities. These branches were based on the main branch and isolated our work.
*4.3. Committing and Pushing to Branches
We followed a systematic approach by committing and pushing our changes to our respective branches. This helped keep the main branch stable while allowing us to develop our features without interference.

**5. Merge and Testing**

*5.1. Merging into Main*

Once we completed our tasks in the respective branches, we initiated a pull request to merge our changes into the main branch. This step ensured that our work was incorporated into the main project while maintaining version control.

*5.2. Code Review and Testing*

Before merging, we reviewed each other's code to identify any issues, inconsistencies, or conflicts. After addressing any concerns, we merged the branches into the main branch.

*5.3. Testing and Debugging*

We performed testing of the integrated code on the main branch to ensure the library system functioned as expected. We identified and resolved any bugs or issues as they arose.

**6. Conclusion**

In conclusion, our collaborative effort in creating a simple library system using GitHub was a successful learning experience. We successfully set up a repository, managed project files, collaborated effectively, created branches, and merged our work. This project not only helped us understand version control and collaboration but also allowed us to create a functional library system. We look forward to future collaborative projects and further enhancing our skills in software development and version control.
